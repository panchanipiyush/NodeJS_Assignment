Q1. What is MongoDB?

MongoDB is a popular open-source document-oriented database program. It uses a flexible document model to store data in JSON-like format, which allows for quick and easy retrieval of data without requiring the use of a SQL-based schema or structure. MongoDB is a NoSQL database, which means that it does not use a fixed schema or structure for its data, and can be used for a wide variety of applications.

Some key features of MongoDB include:

High scalability: MongoDB can scale horizontally across multiple servers, making it suitable for large-scale applications.
High availability: MongoDB provides automatic failover and data redundancy, ensuring that your data remains available even in the event of a hardware failure.
Rich querying and indexing: MongoDB provides a powerful query language that allows for complex queries and supports indexing for fast query execution.
Flexible data model: MongoDB's document model allows for easy storage of complex data structures and supports nested documents and arrays.
Overall, MongoDB is a popular choice for developers who need a scalable and flexible database solution for their applications.

Q2. What is difference between mongo DB and SQL?

MongoDB--->
MongoDB is a document-based, non-relational database management system.Another name for it is an object-based system.
Every record in MongoDB is kept as a separate document.
Documents from a specific class or group are kept in a “collection”
MongoDB supports out-of-the-box replication and sharding and was built with high availability and scalability in mind.
It was created by MongoDB Inc. and was made available on February 11, 2009.

SQL--->
A table-based system is MySQL (or open-source relational database). The table-based architecture, which is regarded as a SQL database, is the data query structure for search.
Each individual entry is saved as a “row” in a database in MySQL.
Rows (also known as records) of a similar sort are kept in a “table.
Although the MySQL architecture does not support effective replication and sharding, one can access related data via joins in MySQL, which reduces duplication.
On April 24, 1989, Microsoft Corporation first made this technology available.
